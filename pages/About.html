            <p>Growing up, I fell in love with arts through music before everything else. And my tryst with technology reinforced the idea that every act should be viewed with the same lens. I thus strongly condone the idea of technology being an artform, and continuous exploration, experiments and creations is my way forward as an aspiring roboticist and an engineer.</p>
            <p>As an engineer, I'm deeply interested in robotics, and currently moving towards motion and perception. My aspirations in robotics are a result of a multidisciplinary engineering journey.I have about 3.5 years of experience in hardware,embedded and software development in startups, academic research labs and multi-national corporations. If curious, I'd love for you to go through my LinkedIn profile. Look at the bottom of this page. You know what to do.</p>
            <p>As a musician, I've been playing guitar for the last 10 years. I love devouring all sorts of genres and continuously exploring to expand my horizons. As a lead guitarist, I'm primarily interested in experimenting with pop, R&B, funk and progressive rock. I'd be elated if you wish to check out my Youtube channel. There's a seperate tab here for you special people!</p>
